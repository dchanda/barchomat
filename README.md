Clash of Clans ClanTool
=========

**Fork of Sir Barchable's Clash of Clans Server**

## What?

Fork of the great Barchomat project. And is modified as client. Where clanmembers can view there history of clanwars, donation,...


## Why?

Supercell doesn't provide an easy way for clan leaders to collect clan and enemy stats. If you want to track the 
performance of the 40+ players in your clan the paper and pencil approach is tedious. 


## Will I get banned for using this?

The best is a separate account, member of the clan, to retrieve private clan data (like chat, clanwars stars,...).


## OK, how do I make it go?

To run the proxy you'll need Java 8, maven, a copy of the proxy, and a copy of the game.
The client reads game logic (hit points, dps etc for the various characters and buildings) from 
the android version of executable, which you'll need to find yourself (Google "clash of clans apk"). Put the client and 
the game executable in the same directory and start the proxy from the command line:

    mvn package
    java -jar barchomat.jar client

## This is crap, and I want to help make it better
  
When it is for the client contact me: *coc@duwe.be*.
When for proxy, server contact the creator of Barchable's: *sir.barchable@gmail.com*.
